# Prometheus

Prometheus is a cloud-native monitoring system entirely focused on gathering
metrics data & creating 'rules' to define conditions for alerting on them.

Its homepage is [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io), and it was developed by
SoundCloud in 2014.

It has since become the defacto standard way to monitor container-driven
workloads in orchestrated environments like Kubernetes, but can be used easily
by non-container workloads too thanks to systems like
[Grafana Agent](../grafana-agent/index.md).
